# GunHead (Motion based FPS)
<name is a work in progress>
We created this application 
for the Object Oriented design class CSC 3380. We aimed to provide an immersive experience that allows
the user to play a motion based first person shooter game with no extra hardware required. We do this by utilising 
opencv's computer vision libraries to track the users movements and then send this information to Unity for game mechanics.

## Description
It is an acrade style game and the user plays as a crypt keeper who kills zombies. 
The objective of the game is to kill as many zombies as you can to get the high score.
  
## Demo
You can see a demo of the game on youtube [here](https://youtu.be/POiYXURz7xE)
